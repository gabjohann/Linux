# History

In 1969 Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories developed the Unix operating system. It was later rewritten in C to make it more portable.
A decade later Richard Stallman started working on the GNU project, the GNU kernel called Hurd. The General Public License (GPL) was also created as a result of this.
The GNU never came to completion and the GPL was a free software license.

The kernel is the most important piece in the operating system. It allows the hardware to talk the software.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds started developing the Linux Kernel.
